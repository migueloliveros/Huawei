Here you will find developments with maxmsp/jitter reactive and immersive audiovisual patches. Also I have included sonic/sound material with Pure Data 64 bits and extended.
I have also drawn inspiration from my previous work in .pd called [d.e.a.r] and also and in particular from the mobile App MobMuPlat: http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/, the reactive patch from: http://www.sebsongs.com/reactiscape/ and m.i.r https://musicinformationretrieval.com
